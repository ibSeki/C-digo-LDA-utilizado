Upload the package use commandline:

```

Currently not upload.

Requiring:

## TODO
We need to specify some interface for `dump` location and `sample` location.

In `setup.py` file, we need to notice the following:
- `version`
- `url`

## Hint
If we want to test the local packaging, we can run the following code:
```
python setup.py sdist
```
